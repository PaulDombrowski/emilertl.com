    <meta name="description" content="Emil Maria Ertl (they/them), *94 in Nürnberg, works as a dancer, choreographer and facilitator in the field of performance art. Both in their own work as well as when collaborating, their main curiosity lies in social relationality and its navigation. When making dance, Emil is interested in porosity, choreography as a container for feelings, holding several perspectives at once, staying with friction, moving within paradoxes, and magic-making. ">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
