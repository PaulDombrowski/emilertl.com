      "Emil Maria Ertl (they/them), *94 in Nürnberg, works as a dancer, choreographer and facilitator in the field of performance art. Both in their own work as well as when collaborating, their main curiosity lies in social relationality and its navigation. When making dance, Emil is interested in porosity, choreography as a container for feelings, holding several perspectives at once, staying with friction, moving within paradoxes, and magic-making.",
      "Emil’s work *Eternal Betrayal* was shown at Ballhaus Ost in the frame of Dirty Debüt, and at ada studios in the frame of NAH DRAN extended.",
      "As a dancer they work with choreographers such as Ligia Lewis, Anan Fries, Olympia Bukkakis, Anna Lublina, Gry Tingskog, Ellen Söderhult and Ar Utke Acs.",
      "Emil is facilitating dance workshops both in community-centers as well as in institutions.",
      "They studied at Tanzfabrik Berlin, Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln and graduated from University of the Arts Stockholm in 2019 with a Bachelor in Dance Performance. In 2023, Emil received the danceWEB scholarship at Impulstanz Vienna.",
      "Emil is based in Berlin and active in Germany, Sweden and internationally."

          "Along the lines of Peaches’ song Serpentine, this research investigates the notion of creases, crumples, wrinkles and folds. Straightened things appear to function, to be correct, to be clean. Wrinkled or crumpled stuff on the other hand commonly is thought of as messy, wild or inappropriate. Serpentine Serpentine wishes to dissect this dichotomy and examine the potential of the act of crumpling. If the act of straightening stands for heteronormativity, can the act of crumpling be a queer act of resistance? How can we use choreography as a tool to research the act of straightening things out?",

          "Eternal Betrayal is a collection of various movie scenes that all portray the same thing: a revelation of a betrayal. In film plots, these scenes classically are followed by relief and reharmonization – a narration through which societal morals are revealed. Those morals often point towards heteronormative, cis-patriarchal ideas of order and loyalty. Driven by the desire to stay with brokenness instead of seeking moralist glue to fix it with, Eternal Betrayal invites to soak in your tears and linger within the clarity of (heart)break.",
